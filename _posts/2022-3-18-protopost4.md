**Introduction**

The Wuque Studio ikki68 Aurora is a budget injection molded Polycarbonate keyboard. It comes in a total of 4 different colorway during the round 1 launch; Charcoal, Mint, Mizu, and Devoted. The price differs for each different model; $129 for both Charcoal and Mint, $159 for Mizu, and $195 for the Devoted. The Charcoal, Mint and Mizu edition comes in a standard package with just the case, a basic coiled cable, Printed Circuit Board (PCB), an aluminum plate, and a hard carrying case. The Devoted edition costed more but it came with a set of JWK Devoted switches (Tactile). The overall keyboard is a beginner friendly keyboard, as the default PCB is in hotswap only and the PCB comes with multiple layouts. The keyboard is also a gasket mounted keyboard and it comes with a set of silicon gasket and poron foam gasket. The multiple options allow beginners to have a fantastic time with choosing how to customize the keyboard to their preference. 

**Typing Experience (Flex/Bounce)**

The overall typing experience of the keyboard is rather stiff despite having removable gasket columns to allow customization for flex and bounce. However, the design of the PCB did not have any flex cut to allow flex when the key is pressed. However, this was later resolved in the round 2 ikki68 aurora with its multiple flex cuts PCB. The round 1 has a much stiffer typing experience and it felt similar to typing on the D65 or a top mounted keyboard. The keyboard overall typing experience is decent and surprisingly good, for beginners to minimal flex of the round 1 when changing the gasket configuration provide a unique and interactive experience. 

**Sound & Sound Isolation**

This leads me to the sound and the sound isolation. The sound of this keyboard is extremely muted. This is because the keyboard comes with a mandatory piece of silicon plate foam. The silicon plate foam is so thick that it absorbs all the sound coming from the switches. The silicon plate foam prevents the switch sound from traveling outwards and immediately muting the keyboard. The keyboard also do not have an extremely good resonance as the case is made from plastic so the sound is similar to other polycarbonate case resulting in a hollow sounding keyboard. 

The gasket provides a decent amount of sound isolation, however, as mentioned the silicon plate simply mutes the entire keyboard. Hence, in my personal opinion render the gasket slightly pointless. Even if the keyboard was in a top mount configuration, the sound of this keyboard will still be equally muted. It would have been better if the keyboard could be built without the silicon plate foam, as that will allow the keyboard sound to travel outwards which the gasket will help to isolate it from reverberating through the polycarbonate case.
