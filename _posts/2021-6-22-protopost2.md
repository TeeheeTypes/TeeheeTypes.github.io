The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Polycarbonate (PC) is a custom mechanical keyboard designed by Ai03 in collaboration with KBDFans. KBDFans is known by the community as the vendor that helps to provide entry level mechanical keyboards. Starting at $285 the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC pricing may be slightly higher than than most entry custom mechanical keyboards. However, the quality provided will offer a much better typing experience than most entry level mechanical keyboards. The initial experience is similar to the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Aluminum.

The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Polycarbonaate (PC) features a similar 65% layout, top mount, soldered/hotswap Printed Circuit Board (PCB), a brass weight and plate. The default brass plate has a fixed layout, catering only for ANSI and 6.25 Units (6.25U) spacebar. The soldered PCB comes with a flex cut in the middle to allow minor flex for the typing feel, however, there is almost 0 flex experience due to the board being a top mount and having a brass plate.

The polycarbonate on the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC is machined to a decent standard for a mid tier custom mechanical keyboard. On my personal unit, the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC came almost perfect on both bottom case and top case. However, the case did not have metal tabs within the screw holes and made the screwing experience slightly worrisome. If the user over tighten the screws, it may result in cracking of the PC case or wearing out the screw thread. Both of which will be undesirable for a board that cost $285.

My personal KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC backplate did not patina after 1-3 months of usage. This is maybe due to the brassplate was not frequently touched or rubbed against the deskmat. Should the brass plate start to patina, the patina can be removed by doing a brass polishing. If you choose to remove it do remember to detach it from the bottom case before attempting to either polish or sand the brass plate as polycarbonate is prone to scratching. 

In conclusion, I will say this keyboard definitely offer a good typing experience if this is the first time you are entering into the hobby. Granted in recent months there are many more custom mechanical keyboards coming out with cheaper pricing such as the Bakeneko, Keychron Q1, ORB60, WORB60 and GMMK Pro. But if you're looking for a starter 65% keyboard the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC is defintiely a board to consider.

This keyboard will not provide you with the luxury or premium feel, however, if you're looking for a decent entry level custom mechanical keyboard it will be able to fill the void. The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC produces a 'thock-ier' sound than the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu. The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu tend to produce a metallic reverb that requires foaming at the bottom plate to reduce the metalic 'ping'. However, the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC is made out of plastic and it does not produce the metallic 'ping'. However, at a $50 top up it may not be the most optimal choice.
