**Introduction**

The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Polycarbonate (PC) is a 65% custom mechanical keyboard designed by Ai03 in collaboration with KBDFans. The keyboard price starts at USD$285 and at that pricing it is slightly higher than most entry custom mechanical keyboards. The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC kit comes in a top mount configuration and provide you with a choice of soldered or hotswap Printed Circuit Board (PCB), a brass weight and plate. 

The default brass plate and PCB only comes with a fixed layout, catering only for ANSI and 6.25 Units (6.25U) spacebar. The soldered PCB comes with a flex cut in the middle to allow minor flex of the PCB, while the hotswap PCB do not come with any flex cut.

**Typing Experience (Flex/Bounce)**

Due to the keyboard comes with a brass plate and top mount configuration, it does not offer much flex or bounce to the keyboard. The typing experience on the keyboard is rather harsh and stiff. If you are someone who enjoys bottoming out each of your key press, you may not enjoy the typing experience of this keyboard. However, if you are a light typist it may suit you better as the keyboard offers all the features of a custom mechanical keyboard at a decent price point.

**Sound & Sound Isolation**

The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC sound exactly like all top mount boards currently within the hobby. The vibration produced by each key press will travel from the plate to the top of the case before traveling down to the bottom case and dissipating itself. The sound of this board is not the best, but if configured properly it does offer a decent sounding keyboard.

However, there are some reports circulating within reddit/geekhack/forums on a metallic buzz during prolong typing. A member in the community managed to isolate the buzz to the brass backweight of the keyboard. It is to my understanding that the brass backweight did not come with a screw that secure the backweight tightly and when the vibration is traveling downwards, it may cause a slight reverb back due to the brass backweight. The problem was resolved by removing the backplate completely.

The keyboard being made out of polycarbonate provide a "thocky" sound as the hobbyist puts it. The pitch on my personal unit was slightly lower than the KBD67 Rev 2.0 Alu. The sound of the board was comparable to some other mid tier top mount board.

**Case Quality**

My personal KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC backweight did not patina after my 1-2 months of usage. The polycarbonate machining on this board was a decent job, there were not visible scratches or machining marks. Overall weight of this keyboard was much lighter than the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Aluminum due to this being a plastic board. There is a visible Ai03 logo on the back of the keyboard. My personal unit being a frosted polycarbonate allows lights to pass through easily. So if you are someone who enjoys backlight, RGB or underglow on your keyboard, the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC can be a potential competitor. 

The top case of this keyboard do not come with a metal insert. So during screwing of keyboard, it is advised against using too much force as it might result in either cracking of the top case or it might remove the screw thread on the top case and casing potential permanent damage.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I will say this keyboard offers a good starting experience if this is the first time you're entering the hobby. This keyboard will not provide you with a luxurious or premium feel, however, if you are looking for a decent entry level custom mechanical keyboard it will be able to fill the void. There are some minor issues with the keyboard, such as you may need insert a layer of the foam beneath the PCB to remove the metallic 'buzz' on KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii PC. But with some simple modifications and tinkering this keyboard will be able to provide you with a decent typing experience and ownership.

**Potential Alternative**

In the recent month, the custom mechanical keyboard scene has grown exponentially and there are more alternative custom mechanical keyboards. In the year 2021, Cannonkeys launched the Bakeneko a 60% aluminum casted mechanical keyboard at only USD$120. GMMK also released their own version of GMMK Pro a 75% gasket mounted aluminum mechanical keyboard at USD$170. In June of 2021, Keychron introduced their 75% gasket mounted aluminum mechanical keyboard and the target price is USD$150 and include both switches and stabilizers. The same month, Charue Design released an O-ring mounted (Gummy Worm) 60% CNC aluminum mechanical keyboard at USD$185 for the non-weighted version and USD$215 for the weighted version. There are other honorable mentions such as Makerkeyboards with their O-ring mounted (Gummy Worm) 65% CNC aluminum mechanical keyboard at USD$215. Please do your due diligence as the buyer before committing to any keyboards.
