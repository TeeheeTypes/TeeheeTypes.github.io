**Introduction**

The Leaf65 by Foxlab is the 2nd iteration of the Leaf collection. The first was the Leaf60 a sandwich mount keyboard and the Leaf65 is a gasket mounted keyboard. Foxlab took great attention in creating a unique sounding keyboard. The Leaf65 introduced a new type of plate called the skeleton aluminum plate, it's a plate that was hollowed out to to only a frame holding the switches in place and for the gasket mounting system. All other aluminum has been milled off to allow as little plate vibration as possible, resulting in what to be heard is purely the sound from the switch and the bottoming out PCB sound. The board overall quality is good for a $415 USD board, but it was biting slightly more than it can chew for a board.

**Typing Experience (Flex/Bounce)**

The typing experience of the board is extremely stiff, the gaskets were compressed tightly and basically act as purely an isolator betweent the plate and the case. There were no flex or bounce on the board as opposed to many other boards designed similarly. The board offers both FR4, PC, Aluminum and Brass plate. The board that was built for the review was with the Aluminum plate. The aluminum plate gave the board an even stiffer typing experience on top of the compressed gasket. 

**Sound & Sound Isolation**

The overall sound of the board is rather muted for a board that was built without foam. The board also came with a plate foam and I cannot imagine if the plate foam was installed as well. The compressed gasket really help to isolate the sound but the case designed muted any possible sound that was coming out of the board. It was a shame that the sound could not travel out freely as opposed to certain other boards. The overall sound was rather similar to 2 other boards that I own; Meridian and Forever65. The Meridian is in Top Mount and Forever65 in Gasket Mount, hence, for the Leaf65 to sound similar to those boards is quite an achievement, albeit it was lacking in the projection of the sound.
