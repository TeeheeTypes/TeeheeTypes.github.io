**Introduction**

The KBDFans D65 is a 65% custom mechanical keyboard designed by KBDFans. The keyboard price starts at USD$259 for the non e-coated case and $289 for the e-coated case. At that pricing it is considered to be slightly higher than most entry custom mechanical keyboards. The D65 kit comes in a gasket mount configuration and provide you with a choice of soldered or hotswap Printed Circuit Board (PCB), a brass weight and brass or polycarbonate plate. 

The default brass plate and PCB only comes with a fixed layout, catering only for ANSI and 6.25 Units (6.25U) spacebar. The soldered PCB comes with a flex cut in the middle to allow minor flex of the PCB, while the hotswap PCB do not come with any flex cut. The PCB provided is the same PCB provided for the KBD67 Rev 2 MKii keyboards.

**Typing Experience (Flex/Bounce)**

Due to the keyboard comes with a brass plate and a low tolerance gasket configuration, it does not offer much flex or bounce to the keyboard. The typing experience on the keyboard is rather harsh and stiff. If you are someone who enjoys bottoming out each of your key press, you may not enjoy the typing experience of this keyboard. However, if you are a light typist it may suit you better as the keyboard offers all the features of a custom mechanical keyboard.

In my personal opinion, the typing experience on the D65 is average at best and it is actually quite similar to the GMMK Pro. This is due to the gasket is over compressed due to the low tolerance and turning the board into a similar mount as a top mount board.

**Sound & Sound Isolation**

Th D65 sound exactly like a gasket mount boards currently within the hobby. The sound isolation is not the best but you can hear substainly less case sound as the gasket despite being over compress is still doing its job in isolating the plate from the case. The sound of this board is not the best, but if configured properly it does offer a decent sounding keyboard.

**Case Quality**

I bought my D65 in the e-white coating for the case and during the case assembly and disassembly what I noticed was the back 4 screwholes are deeper than most screw drivers out in the market. If you're using the Xiaomi Magic Tool or iFixit you'll have issues reaching the screws at the bottom without scratching the case. In my unit I scratched some of the coating off the back 4 screws holes as my iFixit screwdriver was scraping the sides of the case when it reach the screw. 

The D65 brass weight comes with a layer of coating and enamel infill on the words "D65 KBDFans". My D65 backweight did not patina even after half a year of usage. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I will say this keyboard offers a good starting experience if this is the first time you're entering the hobby but I will not recommend it due to the cost. This keyboard will not provide you with a luxurious or premium feel, however, if you are looking for a decent entry level custom mechanical keyboard it will be able to fill the void. The main complain I have on this board is the pricing, with all the other available boards out there today such as the Zoom65, Swift65, KBDFans Lite, Ikki68 Aurora, Portico, etc. they are providing a much better value to the dollar for your personal keyboard.

The D65 while it's good, the board was not designed with sound in their mind. If you're able to look pass that aspect and the board was at least a good $20-30 cheaper then this might be the perfect board. In the recent months, this keyboard has been floating around the aftermarket at under the market price. If you're able to get the board at $50-100 below the cost I believe it is still a decent board to purchase. With the changeable blocker concept and a nice half seam design it is still a good board to have on the table.

**Potential Alternative**

In the recent month, the custom mechanical keyboard scene has grown exponentially and there are more alternative custom mechanical keyboards. In the year 2022, Cannonkeys launched the Bakeneko a 65% cast aluminum mechanical keyboard at USD$165. Please do your due diligence as the buyer before committing to any keyboards.
