**Introduction**

The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Aluminum (Alu) is a custom mechanical keyboard designed by Ai03 in collaboration with KBDFans. KBDFans is known by the community as the vendor that helps to provide entry level mechanical keyboards. Starting at $235 the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii pricing may be slightly higher than than most entry custom mechanical keyboards. However, the quality provided will offer a much better typing experience than most entry level mechanical keyboards.

The KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu features a 65% layout, top mount, soldered/hotswap Printed Circuit Board (PCB), a brass weight and plate. The default brass plate has a fixed layout, catering only for ANSI and 6.25 Units (6.25U) spacebar. The soldered PCB comes with a flex cut in the middle to allow minor flex for the typing feel, however, there is almost 0 flex experience due to the board being a top mount and having a brass plate.

**Flex/Bounce**

The anodization on the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii is decent for a mid tier custom mechanical keyboard. On my personal unit, the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu had a slight anodization mismatched on the bottom case and top case. However, the mismatch is not obvious from a distance unless viewed upon up close. The CNC machining on the board do have a decent feeling to it and there are no visible CNC machining marks on it.

**Sound Isolation**

My personal KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu backplate did started to patina after 6-7 months of usage. This is due to the brassplate is not PVD coated and is subjected to the weather and humidity which may lead to an early onset of patina. But it is nothing that cannot be removed, if you choose to remove it do remember to detach it from the bottom case before attempting to either polish or sand the brass plate. 

**Case Quality**

In conclusion, I will say this keyboard definitely offer a good typing experience if this is the first time you're entering into the hobby. Granted in recent months there are more custom CNC aluminum keyboards coming out with cheaper pricing such as the Bakeneko, Keychron Q1, ORB60, WORB60 and GMMK Pro. But if you're looking for an entry level 65% keyboard the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu is defintiely a board to consider.

**Conclusion**

This keyboard will not provide you with the luxury or premium feel, however, if you're looking for a decent entry level custom mechanical keyboard it will be able to fill the void. There are some minor issues with the keyboard, such as you may have put a layer of the foam beneath the PCB to remove the metallic 'ping' the KBD67 Rev 2.0 MKii Alu tend to create due to the low clearance between the PCB and the bottom case. With simple mods and tinkering, this keyboard will definitely be able to provide you with a wonderful typing experience.
