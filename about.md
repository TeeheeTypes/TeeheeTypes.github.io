I am a relatively new enthusiast in the Custom Mechanical Keyboard hobby.
I write about my experience with the keyboards that I have owned or currently own.
All opinions written in my blog are my personal opinion, please do take it with a pinch of salt.
I hope my writing will help you with choosing your first custom mechanical keyboard.
